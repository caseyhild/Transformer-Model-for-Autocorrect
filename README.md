# Transformer Model for Autocorrect
I implemented, trained, and tested a natural language processing model using the transformer architecture to recognize, interpret, and apply autocorrect to natural language input.<br><br>
With this model, I achieved a loss of 3.0 and an accuracy score of 72% for the final model.<br><br>
Throughout this project, I used the PyTorch library in Python to create the transformer model as well as GitHub and Git for version control.
