# Transformer Model for Autocorrect

I implemented, trained, and tested a transformer-based natural language processing model to recognize, interpret, and apply autocorrect to natural language input. With this model, I achieved a loss of 3.0 and an accuracy score of 72% for the final model. Throughout this project, I used the PyTorch library in Python to create the transformer model as well as GitHub and Git for version control.
